### WebGPU-based 2D and 3D renderer for the browser ðŸŽ¨

## Goals

* **Reinvent the wheel:** Fully understand the system by creating it from scratch, allowing for quickly making highly custom behaviour.
* **High extensibility:** Must be usable across many projects, with the possibility of creating project-specific extensions.
* **Zero third-party dependencies:** Explore what modern browsers are capable of natively (except my own libraries of course!).
* **Vanilla JS:** Plain JavaScript with [JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc) annotations for type checking, no transpilation step necessary.
